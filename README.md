## Install

```shell
    # Install command
    npm i -g nwe
```

## Detailed description

The objective of the project is to be able to facilitate the creation of projects and upload them to github in an easy way as well as simplifying the use of git and making routine tasks like doing commits and add changes much faster by grouping commands. Some current features are:

- inits a new local repos create a new github one
- Clone and clone name change
- Github clone, name change & create a new github repo automatically
- Github token auth
- branch + checkout combined
- add . commit --m "DECRIPTION" push combined
- add . commit --m "DECRIPTION" push origin [branch] combined (detecs the branch automatically)

## Usage

```sh
      # clone and push automatically to your github
      nwe clone [url] 
```

```sh
      # init and push to github (new repo)
      nwe init
```

```sh
      # Adds all the current changes, commits with the set up description and push to the repo
      nwe push [Description, no need for placing " "]
```

```sh
      # Adds all the current changes, commits with the set up description and push to the current branch you are working on at the moment
      nwe push -o [Description, no need for placing " "]
```


```sh
      # Combines branch + checkout [branch_name]
      nwe branch [branch_name]
```

### MKDocs & JSDocs functionality

For this functionality you'll need to follow the documenation of: [Edgar's Custom Material-template](https://gagocarrilloedgar.github.io/mkdocs_template/)

And before install: 

```sh
      npm i jsdoc-to-markdown 
```

```sh
      # Allows to create documentation templates based on MKDocs and use JSDocs to include jsdocs comments into the MKDoc folder
      nwe docs [option]
```

**Create a new project:**

You have to options to create a new project: 

```shell
nwe docs -i # creates de basic template of MKDocs
nwe docs -m # Creates a custom setup based on Material MKDocs
```

**Generate documentation**

You can also automatically generate *.md* files from your *jsdoc* comments using the following command:

```sh
nwe docs -g 
```

In order for this command to work you need to place all your source code inside a src folder located in the root folder (*a new feature will allow to include files from custom folder or even from all the files inside root*)

Also the command is prepared to work wiht the **nwe docs -m** command therefore if you are using your own config you should have the *nav* element of your MkDocs.yml like the following: 

```yaml
nav:
  - Something:
      - ...
  # to have this src here it is important because is where nwe will add the links 
  - src:
      - Commands: src/commands.md
      - Services: src/services.md
```

In addition you should have a **src** folder inside your **doc** folder like this: 

> docs /
>
> 	- â€¦ your files
>  - src/
>    	- source code files will be included here
